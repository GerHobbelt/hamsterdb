1. About

hamsterdb Embedded Storage is a database engine written in ANSI C. It supports 
a B+Tree index structure, uses memory mapped I/O (if available), 
fast Cursors and variable length keys and can create In-Memory Databases.

This release adds a few minor features like setting a custom path for 
log files and re-enabling approximate matching for use with Transactions.
A few bugs were fixed as well, including a crash on Win32.

2. Changes

New Features
* Approximate matching now works if Transactions are enabled (only for
    ham_find)
* Added new parameter HAM_PARAM_LOG_DIRECTORY to specify the directory
    where the log file and the journal files are stored

Bugfixes
* Win32 release builds no longer crash when using Transactions
* Win32: fixed build issue if HAM_DISABLE_COMPRESSION is defined (thanks,
    Andy Thalmann (http://www.softdev.ch))
* hamsterdb 2.0.0 failed to load database files created with hamsterdb 1.x
    because of a bad version check
* Fixed bug where HAM_ONLY_DUPLICATES was ignored when used in a
    Transaction (thanks, Mark Ruijter)

Other Changes
* The internal ham_device_t structure was rewritten as a C++ class. If you
    use this structure to overwrite the device handling then you have to 
    rewrite your code.
* Now using the native Win32 API for os_pwrite and os_pread (thanks,
    Andy Thalmann (http://www.softdev.ch))
* Added a public macro HAM_API_REVISION to allow users to programmatically
    distinguish between new and old interface of ham_txn_begin


To see a list of all changes, look in the file ChangeLog.

3. Roadmap

- more transactional stuff (i.e. recreate pending transactions when 
    recovering from a crash)
- multi threading/concurrency

4. Features

- Very fast sorted B+Tree with variable length keys
- Can run as an in-memory database
- Supports multiple databases in one file
- Supports record number databases ("auto-increment")
- Supports duplicate keys (with sorting)
- Support for logging and recovery
- Support for unlimited number of parallel Transactions
- Support for partial reading/writing of records
- Support for network access (remote databases) through http
- Very fast database cursors 
- Configurable page size, cache size and index key size
- Runs on Linux, Unices, Microsoft Windows, Windows CE and on many
    architectures (also embedded and SPARC)
- Endian-independent file format
- Uses memory mapped I/O for fast disk access (but falls back to read/write if
    mmap is not available)
- Uses 64bit file pointers and supports huge files (>2 GB)
- Easy to use and well-documented
- Supports rudimentary live-reorganization by automatically
    merging freelist entries
- Remote access with embeddable server
- Open source and released under the GPL 2.0 or later
- Supports AES encryption and zlib compression
- Wrappers for C++, Python, Java and .NET

5. Known Issues/Bugs

None.

6. Compiling 

6.1 Linux and Cygwin/Win32

To compile hamsterdb Embedded Storage, run ./configure, make, make install.

Run `./configure --help' for more options (i.e. static/dynamic library, 
build with debugging symbols etc).

6.2 Microsoft Visual Studio 8

A Solution file is provided for Microsoft Visual C++ 2005:
'win32/hamsterdb.sln'. It compiles a static and a dynamic library. 
Please read the README.TXT file in the win32 directory.
All libraries can be downloaded precompiled from the hamsterdb webpage.

To download Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition for free, go to
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/default.aspx.

6.3 Dependencies

hamsterdb will compile out of the box. On Unix, however, remote functionality
will be disabled if libcurl and Google protobuf SDKs are not installed. If
you want to include remote functionality, then you have to download the 
dependencies from here:
    http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/
    http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/
    http://www.boost.org
On Ubuntu, you can install the following packages:
    protobuf-compiler
    libprotobuf-dev
    libcurl-dev
    libboost-dev

For Windows, precompiled libcurl/protobuf libraries are available on 
hamsterdb.com.

7. Testing and Example Code

Make automatically compiles several example programs in the directory
'samples'. To see hamsterdb Embedded Storage in action, just run 'samples/db1' 
or any other sample. (or 'win32/out/samples/db1/db1.exe' on Windows platforms).

8. API Documentation

The header files in 'include/ham' have extensive comments. Also, a doxygen
script is available; run 'make doc' to start doxygen. The generated
documentation is also available on the hamsterdb web page.

9. Other Ways to Compile hamsterdb Embedded Storage

If you want to compile hamsterdb without using the provided ./configure
environment, you have to set some preprocessor macros:

DEBUG                   enable debugging output and diagnostic checks (slow!)
HAM_LITTLE_ENDIAN       compile for little endian machines (i.e. x86)
HAM_BIG_ENDIAN          compile for big endian machines (most other
                            architectures)
HAM_32BIT               compile for 32bit (alias: WIN32)
HAM_64BIT               compile for 64bit (alias: WIN64, also needs WIN32)
HAM_DISABLE_COMPRESSION build without support for zlib compression
HAM_DISABLE_ENCRYPTION  build without support for AES encryption
HAM_ENABLE_REMOTE       build with remote access (needs libcurl/protobuf)
HAM_FAST_ONLY_32BIT     compile a hamsterdb engine which performs
                        all index access in 32 bits only; this limits
						the number of keys you can access/store
						in any environment / database to the unsigned
						32 bit range (~4E9), but it gives you fast
						32-bit integer code. Particularly useful
						when you do not expect to ever need storage
						for more than ~4E9 keys and records, and your
						compiler produces slow 64 bit integer code.
						(Which would be any 32-bit compiler / CPU.)

Also, if you compile for windows, you have to compile the file 'src/os_win32.c',
and ignore the file 'src/os_posix.c'. Vice versa on non-Windows platforms.

10. Porting hamsterdb Embedded Storage

Porting hamsterdb Embedded Storage shouldn't be too difficult. All operating 
system dependend functions are declared in 'src/os.h' and defined 
in 'src/os_win32.c' or 'src/os_posix.c'. 
Other compiler- and OS-specific macros are in 'include/ham/types.h'. 
Most likely, these are the only files which have to be touched. Also see item 
9) for important macros. 

11. Licensing

hamsterdb Embedded Storage can be licensed on a per-developer basis for 
closed source applications. For more details, see 
http://hamsterdb.com/licensing and http://hamsterdb.com/store.

hamsterdb Embedded Storage is released under GPL2 or later. There are several 
exceptions for other open source licenses (see 
http://hamsterdb.com/licensing/exceptions for legal information and a license 
list).
