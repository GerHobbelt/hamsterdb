 
I Am Legend:

Items are sorted by priority (highest on top).
o a pending  TODO item (for the current release)
. a pending  TODO item (for future releases)
x a finished TODO item

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

x performance improvements for extkeys:
    x resize the hash table
    x ownership: one cache per DB, not per ENV
    x when closing the DB: before freeing *ANY* page, call 
        extkey_cache_purge_all() and delete extkey of the DB
    x when freeing the page: don't close extkeys if extkey-cache of this
        db was deleted
    x key_compare_pub_to_int: how can we get around the malloc in 
        db_prepare_...? we need two pointers and they should be owned by
        the database (and NOT overwrite the keyalloc-pointers!)
        -> could store pointers in btree structure

x when using DIRECT_ACCESS and the record is tiny/small (<= 8 bytes) the 
    flag will be ignored (see email from Lionel)
    x add unittests which show the problems
    x and fix them :)

x a small memory leak
    ==12954== 44 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 6
    ==12954==    at 0x4024F20: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:236)
    ==12954==    by 0x40B44E0: alloc_impl (mem.c:38)
    ==12954==    by 0x40B0B5F: _remote_fun_txn_begin (remote.c:663)
    ==12954==    by 0x40A582D: ham_txn_begin (hamsterdb.c:314)
    ==12954==    by 0x8156438: RemoteTest::txnBeginCommitTest() (remote.cpp:494)

x when inserting sequential values (i.e. db1.c) then the hinter should kick
    in and (with help of histograms) do an APPEND or PREPEND
    x if upper_bound or lower_bound was set: set a flag; otherwise unset it
    x if this flag was set: when splitting a page, select the pivot value
        in a higher (or lower) range (or is the current algorithm good enough?)
    x if this flag was set: compare key with upper_bound (or lower_bound)
        on insert/btree_cursor_insert and set force_append/force_prepend
        if it's a hit (and immediately update the histogram)
    x unittests/debugging/profiling

x when repeatedly requesting unused pages from the cache, and the calls always
    fail, the hinter should also kick in and avoid these calls for a certain
    timespan (i.e. only every 5th call will go to the cache)
    x no, don't use the hinter; but rewrite the cache mechanism to get an
        unused page

x monster.sh - errors
    x --data_access_mode=HAM_DAM_SEQUENTIAL_INSERT --keysize=680 --duplicate=1       ../../testfiles/1/190.tst
    x --data_access_mode=HAM_DAM_SEQUENTIAL_INSERT --keysize=680 --duplicate=1       ../../testfiles/1/194.tst
    x --data_access_mode=HAM_DAM_SEQUENTIAL_INSERT --pagesize=1024 --overwrite=1 --keysize=16      ../../testfiles/1/170.tst
    x --data_access_mode=HAM_DAM_SEQUENTIAL_INSERT --pagesize=1024 --overwrite=1 --keysize=16      ../../testfiles/1/ext_021.tst

x release 1.1.7

------------------------------------------------------------

o what about a HAM_RMW flag for ham_insert - it will do a read/modify/write
    operation if the record already exists; but how can we propagate a callback
    for this? 
    o empty/small/tiny records
    o large records
    o in-memory records
    o unittests
    o documentation in header file
    o documentation in wiki

o release new .NET wrapper with fix from a.todorov (-> nabble)
    x move to github
    . add server functionality

o when compiling mongoose it shows a warning (gcc 4)

. add automatic code coverage using gconv
    http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/gcov/
    http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html
    http://aleccolocco.blogspot.com/2009/08/sqlite-lesson-in-low-defect-software.html (section "Test Coverage with GCC")
    o track coverage results, publish online
    o gui tools: http://code.google.com/p/trucov/,
                 http://sourceforge.net/projects/ggcov/files/ 

. remove HAM_HINT_UBER_FAST_ACCESS, HAM_HINT_RANDOM_ACCESS, HAM_HINT_SEQUENTIAL

. unix daemon/windows service
    o new option to set the working directory
    o new option to set the username

. more server stuff
    o add acceptance tests

. more server stuff
    o how could we do authentication?
    . support https?

. disable local client?
    o need configure switch to disable the local client
        -> also clean up db.h, env.h...
    o add tests for --disable-remote and --disable-local to release.sh

. remove the garbage-list from the cache - it's not used

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

o update the Python API 

x move to github

. add server functionality

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

o update the java API 

x move to github

o add server functionality

=======================================================================

o how can we support the following environments
	o threadx
	o vxworks
	o qnx
	o opencl
	o montavista
	o nokia/intel embedded linux
	. openwrt
	. tron
	. itron
	. microitron
	. android
	x wince
	-> and how can we automatically test them? 

. pure java network client

. WinCE: create and run Unittests project
    http://msexchangeteam.com/archive/2004/02/23/78930.aspx
    o also, we could use mmap (which is currently disabled)

. some tests in filter.cpp are deactivated - fix them

. run profiling for duplicate tests - can things be improved?
    o blob_overwrite/duplicate table handling: in some cases we can use
        HAM_DIRECT_ACCESS to speed up things (at least for in-memory)

. webpage changes
    http://www.purenetworks.com/
    http://www.omegathemes.com/tf/smartages/#
    http://eucalyptus.com/
    http://www.pctools.com/de
    x the header page image is too large
    o frontpage: have multiple images (scrolling in background) with more
        text info? 
        http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/basic.html
        http://www.sohtanaka.com/web-design/examples/image-slider/
        http://www.slidedeck.com/
    o sitemap: pulldown with jquery
    o download: need download gates to track in analytics as goals
    o rss feed

. evaluate if we can use bamboo for building and testing on multiple
    platforms
    o http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/features/elastic.jsp#remote
    o install server
    o setup several agents (win32, win64, linux x86, linux x86_64, ...) and
        run either all or only some of the tests, including valgrind!

o need tool to upgrade databases from 1.0.x to 1.1.x!

. ham_get_parameter: could return VERSION of the database

. approx. matching: need a sample

. Ger: can specify an initial file size

. merge threadsafe code

. HighLevelTxnTest::rollbackHugeBlobTest is inactive because huge blobs are
    directly written to disk instead of going through the cache -> in case of
    a txn_abort, these blobs are not reallocated

. win32: check Ger's solution - he can handle multiple msvc versions

. Perl wrapper

. PHP wrapper
