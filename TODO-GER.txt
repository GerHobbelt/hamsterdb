 
I Am Legend:

Items are sorted by priority (highest on top).
o a pending  TODO item (for the current release)
. a pending  TODO item (for future releases)
x a finished TODO item

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

. KEY_IS_DELETED: delay key erasure to later: this is an extremely fast way to
  erase keys, but it leaves the B-tree cluttered with keys which are marked
  but not yet removed.

o check if HAM_ENABLE_RECOVERY is allowed with HAM_WRITE_THROUGH. My docs say no, Christoph's say yes (or rather are silent on this issue)

. remove the requirement to have an even number of keys in a page!

    /*
     * make sure that MAX is an even number, otherwise we can't calculate
     * MIN (which is MAX/2)
     */
    max = p / k;
    max = (max & 1 ? max-1 : max);

. use ham_check_integrity (in 'fast mode'?) or another API call to rebalance the B-tree 
  after serious fast/uber-fast insert and/or erase activity. (Might want to specify a
  'max depth' with that one to limit the run time when there is a LOT of rebalancing 
  to be done.)

o review DB_NEW_PAGE_DOES_THRASH_CACHE - the cache age is not really used,
    therefore this flag is most likely not required 

o review statistics - the "cost" management; is this really in use? where?
    -> leave it as is - Ger might need it again

. remove HAM_HINT_UBER_FAST_ACCESS, HAM_HINT_RANDOM_ACCESS, 
	HAM_HINT_SEQUENTIAL?

  No!

=======================================================================

o how can we support the following environments
	o threadx
	o vxworks
	o qnx
	o opencl
	o montavista
	o nokia/intel embedded linux
	. openwrt
	. tron
	. itron
	. microitron
	. android
	x wince
	-> and how can we automatically test them? 

  --> 1) Code includes support for environs which have slow 64-bit int or no 64-bit int type at all.
   
	  2) using alternative device (flash?) one could go and support deep embedded systems which do not
	     even have a file system (e.g. RTKernel without RTFiles).

o need tool to upgrade databases from 1.0.x to 1.1.x!

  --> might be nice as an example: 'clone_env' or some such.
  
. ham_get_parameter: could return VERSION of the database

. approx. matching: need a sample

. Ger: can specify an initial file size

. HighLevelTxnTest::rollbackHugeBlobTest is inactive because huge blobs are
    directly written to disk instead of going through the cache -> in case of
    a txn_abort, these blobs are not reallocated

  --> I thought I had that one covered. :-S   Re-investigate

. win32: check Ger's solution - he can handle multiple msvc versions
