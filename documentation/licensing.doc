/*! \page licensing HamsterDB Licenses 

la la lala la laaaaaa ....

well, didn't set this whole show up just to show a singing web page. 

Sigh. 



hamsterdb is licensed under either the GPL+GFDL or a commercial license. When you have not purchased a commercial license for hamsterdb, all hamsterdb source code and miscelleneous is subject to the GPL, either version \ref appendix_gpl2 "2" or \ref appendix_gpl3 "3", depending on your preference, while this documentation (and its sources in the documentation/ directory) is subject to the \ref appendix_gnu_free_doc_license :

<ul>
<li>\ref appendix_gpl2
<li>\ref appendix_gpl3
<li>\ref appendix_gnu_free_doc_license

<li>yada yada reference to FOSS EX + COMMERZ licenses; I'm too lazy now to rip that off the site and plonk it in here. Good enough so far.
</ul>
